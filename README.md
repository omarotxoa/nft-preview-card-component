### Process
-  Having recently read about CUBE CSS and other such design systems and philosophies, I wanted to implement some of what I have learned. In particular, I wanted to use CSS Custom Properties and stay away from adding needless classes and media queries - keeping with the natural responsiveness of the browser and using elements to style as much as possible. 
- I chose to ignore the pixel specific breakpoints provided by Front End Mentors style guide, opting to use the natural responsiveness of the browser instead of media queries.
- I threw in @keyframes animations and hover transitions for the fun of it

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Keyframes Animation
- Mobile-first workflow
